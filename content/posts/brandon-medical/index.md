## Introduction:
Over the last 3 months, I have been fortunate enough to have completed 45 days work experience required to complete the Digital T-Level at UTC Leeds, the work placement is a key part of the Digital T-Level, well the T-Level in general to ensure that you are able to gain experience in the sector that you are planning on working in.

## Application process:
When we were given the job listings in November and we were given a timeline to create and produce our CV and Cover Letter for the companies that we wanted to apply for, I read and checked the business that were offering placements, we had companies like Asda, Hippo Digital, Brandon Medical, Leeds City Council, Rodillian Academy. Brandon had immediately stuck out to me as there was a task set. Brandon had set out that they wanted to create a Moodle site for Staff eLearning. 

As we have got the servers that were available at college I had tested and checked moodle out before applying. With the small bit of work that I did with Moodle it seemed like something that would be interesting.

## Networking and Connections:
During my time at Brandon I had spoken regularly with the CEO, HR Manager and many department leads. As LinkedIn is a useful platform for managing connections and maintaining a connection.
