## Pre-Information:
The code below in the configuration for a Cisco 1921 with a class C Network where the router has been given the IP address 172.16.0.1. This has got a DHCP range of 100 IP address range address.  There are 0 VLAN's currently configured but the plan is to have a VLAN for the servers so that only allowed devices are able to speak with the server. We are also using a Cisco switch that is running POE for our AP device.

| ip nat inside source {list{access-list-number | access-list-name}} interface type number[overload] | Establishes dynamic source translation. Use of the “list” keyword enables you to use an ACL to identify the traffic that will be subject to NAT. The “overload” option enables the router to use one global address for many local addresses. |

| switchport access                        | Configures a specific Ethernet port on a switch to operate in access mode to accommodate an end device such as a computer, server or printer. The port must then be assigned to a single VLAN. |
| vlan vlan-id [name vlan-name]            | Configures a specific VLAN name (1 to 32 characters)                                                 |
| switchport mode { access | trunk }       | Configures the VLAN membership mode of a port. The access port is set to access unconditionally and operates as a non-trunking, single VLAN interface that sends and receives non-encapsulated (non-tagged) frames. An access port can be assigned to only one VLAN. The trunk port sends and receives encapsulated (tagged) frames that identify the VLAN of origination. A trunk is a point-to-point link between two switches or between a switch and a router. |
| switchport trunk {encapsulation { dot1q }} | Sets the trunk characteristics when the interface is in trunking mode. In this mode, the switch supports simultaneous tagged and untagged traffic on a port. |
