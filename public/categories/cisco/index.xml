      <description>Pre-Information:The code below in the configuration for a Cisco 1921 with a class C Network where the router has been given the IP address 172.16.0.1. This has got a DHCP range of 100 IP address range address. There are 0 VLAN&rsquo;s currently configured but the plan is to have a VLAN for the servers so that only allowed devices are able to speak with the server. We are also using a Cisco switch that is running POE for our AP device.
